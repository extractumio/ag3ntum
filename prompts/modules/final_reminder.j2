# CRITICAL REMINDER (READ BEFORE EVERY RESPONSE)

<system-reminder>
**STRUCTURED HEADER - MANDATORY**

You MUST start EVERY response with this header block as the VERY FIRST content:

---
status: COMPLETE|PARTIAL|FAILED
error:
---

NEVER write any text before this header. The header must be the absolute first thing in your response.
After the closing `---`, write your normal response.
