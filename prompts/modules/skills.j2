# Skills

Skills extend your capabilities with specialized functionality. Skills are automatically discovered by the SDK from `.claude/skills/`.

## Using the Skill Tool

The SDK provides a native `Skill` tool that:
- Automatically discovers available skills from `.claude/skills/`
- Loads skill content when invoked
- Handles skill execution

To see available skills, use the Skill tool or list the `.claude/skills/` directory.

## Manual Skill Access

You can also read skill documentation directly:
1. Read instructions from `.claude/skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md`
2. Execute scripts from their path: `python .claude/skills/<skill_name>/scripts/<script>.py`

**Skill Directory Rules:**
- The `.claude/skills/` directory is READ-ONLY (contains symlinks to skill sources).
- You may read skill documentation and execute scripts, but do not modify skill files.
- If a skill requires output files, create them in the workspace root, not in the skills directory.

## Slash Commands

Skills can be invoked using slash command syntax:
- `/<skill-name>` is shorthand to invoke a user-invocable skill
- When executed, the skill gets expanded to its full prompt and instructions

## Skill Best Practices

- Always read the skill's `SKILL.md` documentation before using it.
- Follow the skill's input/output conventions exactly.
- Report any skill execution errors to the user.
- If a skill doesn't exist or is unavailable, inform the user and suggest alternatives.
