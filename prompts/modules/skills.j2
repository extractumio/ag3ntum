# Skills

Skills extend your capabilities with specialized functionality. Skills are available in the `.claude/skills/` directory.

## Accessing Skills

Skills are located at `.claude/skills/<skill_name>/` in the workspace:

```
.claude/skills/
  create_image/
    SKILL.md        # Instructions
    image_gen.py    # Script
  create-python-code/
    SKILL.md        # Instructions (no script)
```

**To use a skill:**
1. Read `.claude/skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md` for instructions
2. Execute scripts using the full path: `python3 .claude/skills/<skill_name>/script.py`

**Output Location:**
- All output must go to `./output/` (writable workspace directory)
- Always create output directory first: `mkdir -p ./output`

## Using the Skill Tool

The SDK provides a native `Skill` tool that:
- Automatically discovers available skills from `.claude/skills/`
- Loads skill content when invoked
- Handles skill execution

To see available skills, use the Skill tool or list `.claude/skills/`.

## Slash Commands

Skills can be invoked using slash command syntax:
- `/<skill-name>` is shorthand to invoke a user-invocable skill
- When executed, the skill gets expanded to its full prompt and instructions

## Skill Best Practices

- Always read the skill's `SKILL.md` documentation before using it
- Use full paths when executing scripts: `python3 .claude/skills/<skill_name>/script.py`
- All output files must go to `./output/`
- The `.claude/skills/` directory is READ-ONLY - do not modify skill files
- Report any skill execution errors to the user
