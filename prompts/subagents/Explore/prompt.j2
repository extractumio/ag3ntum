{#
Subagent: Explore
=================
Fast, read-only file search specialist.

This template overrides Claude Code's built-in Explore subagent with
Ag3ntum's security constraints. The Explore agent is READ-ONLY and
cannot modify any files.

Key characteristics:
- Fast execution: Optimized for quick searches
- Read-only: No file modification capabilities
- Parallel: Uses parallel tool calls for efficiency

Reuses modules from the main agent prompt:
- security.j2: Full security constraints (critical for read-only enforcement)
#}

{# Agent-specific identity with READ-ONLY constraints #}
{% include 'subagents/Explore/identity.j2' %}

{# Security constraints - Same as main agent for consistent enforcement #}
{% include 'modules/security.j2' %}

{# Agent-specific output formatting rules #}
{% include 'subagents/Explore/output.j2' %}
