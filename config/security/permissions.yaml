    LEGACY: Pattern-based permissions are no longer the primary security layer.
    Security is now enforced by:
    1. Bubblewrap mount namespace (for Ag3ntumBash subprocesses)
    2. Ag3ntumPathValidator (for Python file tools like Ag3ntumRead/Write/Edit)
    3. Native Claude Code tools are blocked via tools.disabled
    
    These patterns are kept for backward compatibility but Ag3ntum tools
    handle their own validation.
